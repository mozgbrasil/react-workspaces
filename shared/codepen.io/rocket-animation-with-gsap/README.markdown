# Rocket Animation with GSAP

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/petebarr/pen/BLVOOj](https://codepen.io/petebarr/pen/BLVOOj).

Beginnings of a preloader for a new project. Will use CSS animations initially to reduce the load in the head and then uses GSAP to animate out the rocket on window load.

This prototype was done whilst employed at Murray Creative.
